# Pair-Clustering-Graph-Wavelet-Packets

Design graph wavelet packet by first hierarchical pair-clustering the standard basis and graph Laplacian eigenvectors. 
Then, construct wavelet by iterative project the standard basis to the corresponding eigenspaces.
At last, we could use the best basis algorithm for graph signal approximation.
