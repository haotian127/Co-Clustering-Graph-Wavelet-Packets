# Natural Graph Wavelet Dictionaries

Design graph wavelet packet by first hierarchical pair-clustering the standard basis and graph Laplacian eigenvectors. 
Then, construct wavelet by iterative projecting the standard basis to the corresponding eigenspaces.
At last, we could use the best basis algorithm for graph signal approximation.
